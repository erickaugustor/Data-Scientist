## About <a name="about"></a>

This is the first project for Udacity's nanodegree of Data Scientist.
The idea is using the knowledge of the session "Introduction of Data Science".


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries.

For install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this Udacity Nanodegree's project I choose an open dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness) to analyze and apply the knowledge lerned in the session. 

My interested was analyze the Happiness across the world and try to see if there's any relation about Money and Happiness on this dataset.

For this, I formulated four questions regarding the dataset:

1. Thereâ€™s a country that is out of the medium range of happiness in comparison to the countries of the same continent?
2. How the Happiness Score is related to the Economy by the continent?
3. Which are the aspects that influence the Happiness Score of the countries in 2019?
4. Which are the countries with more variation in the Happiness Score cross the years?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Kaggle dived the research of Happines Report in 5 datasets.

2015.csv
2016.csv
2017.csv
2018.csv
2019.csv

On the datasets is possible to see fields like economics, psychology, happiness score, national statistics, health, public policy, and more.

Also was added some files related to the analyze process.

## Process<a name="process"></a>

This project used the CRISP-DM Data Science Process, that consists in some actions:
1. Business Understanding: By analyzing the context of the report
2. Data Understanding: By applying ths analyze to the dataset and observe the data.
3. Data Preparation: Removing unecessary things and adapting the dataset (like combining the 5 datasets).
4. Data modeling
5. Result evaluation: Make some observations about the results.
6. Deploy


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The results of the research was published on a [post](https://medium.com/@erick.augustoramos/happiness-across-the-world-the-impact-o-social-aspects-on-happiness-of-their-people-735ae0eb1474) available on Medium with all the graphs ploted and the resume about it.
